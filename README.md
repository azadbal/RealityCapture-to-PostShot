# RealityCapture-to-PostShot
This batch script is a super easy way to automate going from an unaligned set of images -> trained 3DGS with a single click by using RealityCapture and PostShot.

## Setup

The script requires that you have the project set up as the following:
- Project root folder
  - "images"

Open the `RC_3DGS_train.BAT` and change the directories, specifically the `RealityCaptureExe`, `PostShotEXE`, and `SettingsFolder` to local ones.

## Usage

Place the BAT file into the root of a project. Make sure the images are in a subfolder called "images". 

To run it, either double click on the BAT file, accept the permissions that windows asks, and see it run. OR, if it crashes and you want to see the error messages, run it via command line.
